# 🃏 Guess the Card Game

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**  
   Run the Python script. It will secretly select one of the following cards at random:
   - `jack`
   - `queen`
   - `king`
   - `ace`

2. **Make a Guess**  
   You'll be prompted to enter your guess. Type one of the four card names listed above.

3. **Check Your Answer**  
   - If your guess is correct, the game will congratulate you and reveal the card.
   - If your guess is incorrect, the game will prompt you to try again.

4. **Invalid Input**  
   If you enter anything that's not one of the valid card names, the game will exit with an error message.

> 💡 Tip: All inputs are case-insensitive, so "Ace", "ace", or "ACE" will all be accepted as valid guesses.

Have fun and good luck guessing the card!
